 # Mam, introduced us about the Value Education 
 Starting with the introduction of the students, Mam started the class telling us about the need of value education .                                                                             
 For human being there are two important questions:-                                         
    • What is my aspiration ?                                          
    • How to fulfill my aspiration?                                                
                                                                                    
 Human being mainly have two desires?
           - Happiness.            - Prosperity 

 <mark> Guidelines for Value Education </mark>
      •Universal                                                      
      •Rational.                                                   
      •Natural and verifiable                                          
      •All Encompassing                                       
      •Harmony

  <mark> Basic Requirements for fulfillment of Human Aspiration </mark>.                       
  For human being physical facility is necessary but relationship is also necessary.                                                             • For animals, physical facility is necessary as well as adequate.               
          • For human being, physical facility is necessary but physical facility alone is not adequate.          
    
-Therefore in conclusion for fulfillment of human being- physical facility, relationship and right understanding all three are necessary.                                                                                                      

   <mark> Role of Education Sanskar </mark>
   •for holistic development and right understanding.                   
   •Capacity to live in relationship with other human being.                                 
   •Capacity to understand Physical facility needs.                                                  
   •Comitment to live with right understanding.                                                  

<mark> What is self exploration</mark>.                                    
It is a process of seeing the reality on our own right,by our own investigation and observation                                        
      Happiness is the state of Harmony.                                                      
      Unhappiness is to be forced to be in state of contradiction.                                

  At last mam told us about the Meaning of Harmony and Prosperity .

• He taught us about different basics of Science like surface tension etc.       
• He believed we all know smart tricks, we just have to observe and apply them in real life.        
• He explained the concept of conductance with a rain alarm very well.      
• He also compared balance in life with mathematics            
• He said that we all have seen these experiments in our textbooks but never tried them in real life.    
• He also explained the concept of electrostatics using rubber balloons.     
• Trying these experiments practically gives the clearance to the concepts.    
• From Sir's lecture we can infer that it is better to understand the concepts of Science and mathematics rather than craming theory and should apply them in life.

He made us take out pin pages from our notebooks and told us to write our name on it, Our parent's names, Their mobile numbers, Our mobile numbers and some of our academic details as well

Then he asked us questions regarding our hobbies, our aim in life, things we are doing to fulfill that aim, the flaws we find in the education system on GNDEC and what is our suggestion to resolve the issues if there are any

Then he told us that behind writing all this stuff his basic motive was to remind us of ourselves and our ambition in life

Then he told us about a poison which has been embedded into student's minds which is known as package

He told us that besides running for packages after your graduation, Be your own package

Inculcate such level of excellence and skills in yourself that you don't have to run for packages rather companies approach you and ask for the package of your choice

He had his own way of enlightening us through his amazing life experience

He also criticised the use of google by people for every problem in their daily lives rather he said that we need to start trusting on people

• He told us to read books like The Igniited Minds by Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam to make our lives at ease

He gave us the slogan of No Tesnsion, Full Attention

Then came Dr. Pushpinder Singh and gave us the following share of his knowledge

He firstly asked us question that said, "How many of you retain the lecture by only listening?", "How many of you retain the lecture by making notes?", "How many of you retain the lecture by relating the book knowledge to real life?"

His basic aim in asking these questions was that he wanted to know the studying pattern of students

Then he taught us the meaning of surface learning and deep learning

When we read a book only and just accept the facts provided in the lessons without checking them is known as surface learning

When we read a book and analyse the facts provided in any lesson by comparing them with real life things is known as deep learning

Another excellent way of learning things is by making them explain to your friend. This is the most efficient way of putting something u learnt into your subconscious mind

Mental health issues do arise in professional colleges

• Learn everything because it helps in your life. Whatever you are made to study in the

college's first year, do study it thoroughly because you don't know at which point in your

life it would help you out

Then he gave us a tremendous example of living with gratitude by making us show a fact

that the trees like bamboo whenever a storm comes bend themselves and survive the

storm. While trees like peepal which don't bend themselves get blowed away in the

storm. This showed that we should learn how to have a positive attitude to survive in

storm like situations in life
