 # Mam, introduced us about the Value Education 
 Starting with the introduction of the students, Mam started the class telling us about the need of value education .                                                                             
 For human being there are two important questions:-                                         
    • What is my aspiration ?                                          
    • How to fulfill my aspiration?                                                
                                                                                    
 Human being mainly have two desires?
           - Happiness.            - Prosperity 

 <mark> Guidelines for Value Education </mark>
      •Universal                                                      
      •Rational.                                                   
      •Natural and verifiable                                          
      •All Encompassing                                       
      •Harmony

  <mark> Basic Requirements for fulfillment of Human Aspiration </mark>.                       
  For human being physical facility is necessary but relationship is also necessary.                                                             • For animals, physical facility is necessary as well as adequate.               
          • For human being, physical facility is necessary but physical facility alone is not adequate.          
    
-Therefore in conclusion for fulfillment of human being- physical facility, relationship and right understanding all three are necessary.                                                                                                      

   <mark> Role of Education Sanskar </mark>
   •for holistic development and right understanding.                   
   •Capacity to live in relationship with other human being.                                 
   •Capacity to understand Physical facility needs.                                                  
   •Comitment to live with right understanding.                                                  

<mark> What is self exploration</mark>.                                    
It is a process of seeing the reality on our own right,by our own investigation and observation                                        
      Happiness is the state of Harmony.                                                      
      Unhappiness is to be forced to be in state of contradiction.                                

  At last mam told us about the Meaning of Harmony and Prosperity .
